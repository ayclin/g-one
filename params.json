  "body": "The convergence of smartphones into the daily life of people and their ever increasing mobile capabilities, states the importance of the mobile network solutions in the twenty first century. Opportunistic networks gained a great attention in the research community due to their special characteristics. They are able to handle delay and disruptions in the network and recover a lost connection by finding and establishing another way to the destination without losing any data in the process. The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator is the most powerful tool to simulate and understand the performance of routing protocols in this kind of network, which is widely being used by the research community. Unfortunately, it is solely able to run the unicast simulation scenarios. Based on our research requirements in, we modified the core of the ONE simulator and enable the ability to simulate the geocast addressing methodology. In this paper, we introduce Geo ONE package, a geocasting enabled version of the ONE simulator software which is able to run geocasting and unicasting scenarios, simultaneously. Geo ONE enables the ability to evaluate the state of the art geocasting routing solutions ( i.e. GSAF, EVR, GEOOPP and GeoEpidemic) for the opportunistic networks.",
